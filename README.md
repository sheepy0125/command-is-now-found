# Command is now found

### Release 1.0.0

A simple-but-powerful tool to scrape [command-not-found.com](https://command-not-found.com) (which I did not make, see [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)) as the only public API available is for Alpine Linux.

## Features / road-map
- [x] Scrapes [command-not-found.com](https://command-not-found.com)  
- [x] Gives a summary of the commands for each distribution  
- [x] Can auto-determine the distribution to look for (opt-in)  
- [x] Can auto-install (opt-in)  

## Installation

You'll need [git](https://command-not-found.com/git) and [cargo](https://command-not-found.com/cargo) installed  .
Then, in a directory where you go to compile stuff (preferably `/opt` if your permissions are set up correctly but anywhere is fine):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sheepy0125/command-is-now-found
cd command-is-now-found
cargo install --path .
```
Then, you could put something like this in your shell's rc file to make it easier:
```bash
alias how='command-is-now-found -i -r -c'
```
so you can use `how curl` for example.  
If you're going to do this, please check [Usage](#usage) and [Examples](#examples) for the flags.

## Disclaimer
I am not the owner of nor have any relation to [command-not-found.com](https://command-not-found.com) and do not condone sending a huge number of requests to it. I just use this as an easier method than switching to my web browser and I suggest you do only that as well. When making this, I downloaded the `curl` page from the website and used a web server to host it locally.
